# DatabaseManagement

I have created a simulated database for a business whose objective is to be a Travel guide- who provide plans of different destinations that the business is tied up with. This can help people plan their vacations which includes Hotels, Activities, Restaurants, travel plans, customers and their orders

This operational Database can be useful to track customers and their travel plans. This management system is designed for the users to modify and manage data in real time. It is designed to easily monitor and retrieve information from different tables and their relationship. The forms allow the users to fill information and navigate easily to keep track of basic transactions. While Reports can be generated based on specific plans to specific cities and also print details of customer bookings (Orders)
