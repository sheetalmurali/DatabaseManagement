# DatabaseManagement

I have created a simulated database for a business whose objective is to be a Travel guide- who provide plans of different destinations that the business is tied up with. This can help people plan their vacations which includes Hotels, Activities, Restaurants, travel plans, customers and their orders

This operational Database can be useful to track customers and their travel plans. This management system is designed for the users to modify and manage data in real time. It is designed to easily monitor and retrieve information from different tables and their relationship. The forms allow the users to fill information and navigate easily to keep track of basic transactions. While Reports can be generated based on specific plans to specific cities and also print details of customer bookings (Orders)

Following this, I moved the database to a multi-dimensional database, I downloaded SQL Server where I imported the data from MS. Access to SQL Server Analysis Services database in Visual Studio using SQL Server Import Export, for this project I have created one cube with the one Fact and 4 Dimensions table by converting the ER Model to Star Shema. Used (Excel) BI Dashboard for analysis and finally made cube available offline
